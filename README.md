# Albanian Map
This is a project that I built for my Florida National Guard Unit prior to their deployment to Albania in April of 2021. Two maps were developed using the Folium package for Python and used data provided by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The first map is a conflict map showing various types of conflict events in Albania over a three year period. The second map is a heatmap that demonstrates population density throughout Albania.
